\section {Introduction}
GeomLab is a tiny programming environment for a simple functional programming language with graphics primitives.
 It is used to introduce high school students to computer programming and some of the most important ideas in computer programming in an interactive
\subsection {Background }
Programming using geomlab requires very many work sheets which are run only when you are connected to the internet .It also requires the use of a specific programming language makes it more complicated. Due to all the challenges being faced, programmers waste a lot of time while working with all the work sheets and searching for internet ,and programmers used to other programming languages are discouraged        


\subsection {Problem statement}
New programmers find it hard to interpret recursion which is a very powerful mathematical concept. More so the software students use require a series of worksheets which is hard for starting programmers. Geomlab has a turtle graphics feature, but the pictures are drawn only on the screen.
\subsection{ Aim and objectives}
\subsubsection{ General objective}
To enhance the performance of geomlab
 \subsubsection {Specific objectives}
To establish a system that can run and be accessed on all kinds of computers and related devices.
\newline To find out the way of using less work sheets.
\newline To establish a system that can many programming languages

\subsection {Research scope}
Basically the only way we collected data of this topic since we had no idea of the geomlabs was by the internet. During our researching process we experienced a few limitations as follows;
\begin{itemize}
\item Measure used to collect data.
\item Lack of available/reliable data.
\item Sample size. 
\item Lack of prior research studies on geomlabs.
\item Insufficient time to do enough research on the topic.
\end{itemize}
\subsection {Research significance}
This document provides you with a brief introduction on geomlabs, what they do and how they are used. To users of this programming environment, there have a number of challenges faced, and so it briefly mentions the problems geomlabs users face and how best these problems can be addressed by those concerned accordingly.
